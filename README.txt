About
-----
rainCalculator.py was created to aid the farmers of Codetopia collect data on rainfall to convince the King that they need more rain or funds for water and/or food for their crops and livestock.

rainCalculator.py calculates the total rainfall, the average rainfall per week, and the average rainfall per day.

The program asks the user how many weeks he would like to record rainfall for.

The user will then be asked for the mm of rainfail for each day of the week and this will be iterated using nested loops for each week the user enters.
